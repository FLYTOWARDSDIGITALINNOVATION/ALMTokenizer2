# ALMTokenizer2: Towards Low bit-rate and Semantic-rich Audio Tokenizer with Flow-based Scalar Diffusion Transformer Decoder

This repository will release the source code and weight for our latest work, ALMTokenizer2. ALMTokenizer2 combines the tranditional frame-by-frame quantization strategy 
and query-based quantization strategy to enhance the semantic information and reconstruction performance. Furthermore, it introudce a flow-based scalar diffusion transformer decoder to improve 
the reconstruction performance. Compared to ALMTokenizer, the experimental results show that ALMTokenizer2 significantly improves the reconstruction performance, especially for sound and music data.
