## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, efficient audio processing is crucial. The ALMTokenizer2 project aims to enhance audio tokenization by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Our tokenizer is designed to reduce the bit-rate while maintaining rich semantic content, making it ideal for various applications, including streaming and storage.

## Features

- **Low Bit-rate Encoding**: The tokenizer compresses audio data effectively, making it suitable for low-bandwidth environments.
- **Semantic-Rich Output**: The use of a flow-based scalar diffusion transformer ensures that the audio retains its semantic meaning even after compression.
- **Open Source**: The project is open for contributions, allowing developers to enhance and adapt the code as needed.
- **Easy Integration**: The tokenizer can be easily integrated into existing audio processing pipelines.

## Installation

To get started with ALMTokenizer2, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FLYTOWARDSDIGITALINNOVATION/ALMTokenizer2.git
   cd ALMTokenizer2
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download and Execute**:
   You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/FLYTOWARDSDIGITALINNOVATION/ALMTokenizer2/releases). Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the release notes for execution.

## Usage

Using the ALMTokenizer2 is straightforward. Here's a basic example of how to tokenize audio data:

1. **Import the Library**:
   ```python
   from alm_tokenizer import ALMTokenizer
   ```

2. **Initialize the Tokenizer**:
   ```python
   tokenizer = ALMTokenizer()
   ```

3. **Tokenize Audio**:
   ```python
   tokens = tokenizer.tokenize("path/to/your/audio/file.wav")
   ```

4. **Process Tokens**:
   After tokenization, you can process the tokens as needed for your application.

For more advanced usage, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.
